The two major use cases of Machine Learning in manufacturing are Predictive Quality & Yield, and Predictive Maintenance.

**Predictive Maintenance** is the more commonly known of the two, given the significant costs maintenance issues and associated problems can incur, which is why it is now a fairly common goal amongst manufacturers.

Instead of performing maintenance according to a predetermined schedule, or using SCADA systems set up with human-coded thresholds, alert rules and configurations, predictive maintenance uses algorithms to predict the next failure of a component/machine/system. Personal can then be alerted to perform focused maintenance procedures to prevent the failure, but not too early so as to waste downtime unnecessarily. By contrast, traditional manual and semi-manual approaches don’t take into account the more complex dynamic behavioral patterns of the machinery, or the contextual data relating to the manufacturing process at large. For example, a sensor on a production machine may pick up a sudden rise in temperature. A static rule-based system would not take into account the fact that the machine is undergoing sterilization, and would proceed to trigger a false-positive alert.

The advantages are numerous and can significantly reduce costs while eliminating the need for planned downtime in many cases.

By preempting a failure with a machine learning algorithm, systems can continue to function without unnecessary interruptions. When maintenance is needed, it’s very focused – technicians are informed of the components that need inspection, repair and replacement; which tools to use, and which methods to follow.

Predictive maintenance also leads to a longer Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machinery and equipment since secondary damage is prevented while smaller labour forces are needed to perform maintenance procedures.
